# BlackHat MEA Final 2024

In this event, there were 7 PWN challenges in total that were given in the span of three days. Unfortunately, I could only solve one of them during the event, and it was a sanity check XD.&#x20;

These are the 7 challenges from the Finals, in order of the days they came out:

1. CRC32
2. Union
3. MeaVM
4. readfile (the only one I solved :sob:)
5. Flexvec
6. i2c-echo
7. Landlock

I won't be writing about all of them since... ehem... I have skill issue.
